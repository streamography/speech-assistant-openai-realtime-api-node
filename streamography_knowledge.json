  "faq": [
    {
      "q": "Where are you located and what areas do you serve?",
      "a": "We are based in Gloucester, Massachusetts, on the North Shore. We regularly serve Gloucester, Cape Ann, and surrounding New England communities. Streamography has supported events from Hawaii to Portugal and nearly every time zone in between, so travel is possible for the right projects."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can you give me exact pricing over the phone?",
      "a": "Our pricing is customized based on the event date, location, timing, crew needs, and deliverables. The AI assistant is NOT allowed to quote exact numbers or even rough price ranges. Instead, it should explain that we’ll put together a simple proposal after a quick discovery call with a human producer."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I book a project or event with Streamography?",
      "a": "The best next step is to schedule a short call with a producer so we can confirm the date, location, and needs. After that, we send a written proposal and agreement. A signed agreement and deposit are usually required to officially reserve the date."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do you record the livestream so we can watch it later?",
      "a": "For most livestream setups, we can record the event as well, but it should always be confirmed with a human producer in the proposal. The assistant should never guarantee a specific recording format or resolution—just say that recording is often available and can be discussed in the planning call."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can you help if I’ve never done a livestream or video project before?",
      "a": "Yes. A big part of what we do is walk clients through the process step by step. We explain options in plain language and help decide what’s essential versus ‘nice to have’ so the project feels manageable."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do you only work with big events and companies?",
      "a": "No. Streamography works with a mix of families, local organizations, and small to mid-sized businesses. Some projects are simple one-camera setups; others are more involved. The goal is to match the level of production to what the client actually needs."
    },
    {
      "q": "What should I have ready before talking to a producer?",
      "a": "Basic details like the event date, location, approximate timing, whether you need livestreaming, recording, or both, and where you expect people to watch from (in-person, online, or a mix). If you don’t know all the answers, that’s okay—a producer can help you sort it out."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can you handle both in-person audio and the livestream audio?",
      "a": "In many cases, yes. We can coordinate with the venue’s sound system or bring our own audio gear if needed. Exact details depend on the space, so it’s something we confirm during planning."
    },
    {
      "q": "What if I just want help with a podcast or video idea, not a big production?",
      "a": "That’s fine. We’re happy to start small—sometimes that means a simple studio session, a pilot episode, or a short test project to see what works before committing to something bigger."
    },
    {
      "q": "What should the AI assistant do if it doesn’t know the answer to a question?",
      "a": "The AI should say it’s not completely sure, avoid guessing, and invite the caller to schedule a call or request a follow-up from a human producer."
